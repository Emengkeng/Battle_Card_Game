## Installation

1. In the `client` directory, we run the React app. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    cd client
    npm i
    
    npm run start
    ```


5. Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.
    ```javascript
    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run test
    ```

6. To build the application for production, use the build script. A production build will be in the `client/build` folder.
    ```javascript
    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run build
    ```

## FAQ


* __Where is my production build?__

    The production build will be in the `client/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `client` folder.

* __Where can I find more documentation?__
 React setup created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Either one would be a great place to start!
